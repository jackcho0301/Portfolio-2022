### Swift (iOS) Project Code Sample
[Link to the code repository](https://github.com/jackcho0301/Portfolio-2022/tree/master/Housemate-Chores-App(Swift))

This is a code snippet from an iOS application project. The code achieves the following:
- Import iOS Calendar library made by WenchaoD (https://github.com/WenchaoD/FSCalendar)
- Clicking on a specific cell of the calendar allows the users to create and delete events
- Connect with Firebase Realtime Database for data persistence
- Display all events created by a fellow group of housemates (and ignore events made by users that are not housemates)
